    <h1>Malware Analysis</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for analyzing malware using multiple deep learning models such as GAN, CNN, Random Forest, and SVM.</p>
    <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)</h2>

    <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a deep learning model used for generating synthetic data, and is one of the models used for malware analysis in this repository. The          code for this model can be found in the GAN folder.The idea is to use a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm to generate adversarial malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based detection models.Figure 1 shows the adversarial malware generatorâ€™s training architecture.</p>
    <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h2>

    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a deep learning model used for image classification, and is another model used for malware analysis in this repository.The CNN model used for this project consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is trained on the dataset using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss.The code for this model can be found in the CNN folder.</p>
    <h2>Random Forest</h2>

    <p>The Random Forest model used for this project consists of multiple decision trees, each trained on a subset of the dataset. The model is trained on the dataset using the Random Forest algorithm, which generates predictions by aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees.</p>
    <h2>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4 : SVM Architecture</p>
    <p>In the DL-SVM classifier we use three models for malware classification: MLP-SVM, GRU-SVM, and CNN-SVM. MLP-SVM combines a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with a  SVM classifier and similarly the other models.In all three models, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training set. The model is then evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.</p>
