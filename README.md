    <h1>Malware Analysis</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for analyzing malware using multiple deep learning models such as GAN, CNN, Random Forest, and SVM.</p>
    <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 : GAN Architecture</p>
    <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a deep learning model used for generating synthetic data, and is one of the models used for malware analysis in this repository. The          code for this model can be found in the GAN folder.The idea is to use a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm to generate adversarial malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based detection models.Figure 1 shows the adversarial malware generatorâ€™s training architecture.</p>
    <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h2>

    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a deep learning model used for image classification, and is another model used for malware analysis in this repository.The CNN model used for this project consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is trained on the dataset using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss .The code for this model can be found in the CNN folder.</p>
    <h2>Random Forest</h2>

    <p>Random Forest is a machine learning model that uses decision trees to generate predictions, and is another model used for malware analysis in this repository. The code for this model can be found in the Random Forest folder.</p>
    <h2>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h2>
